# Uber for drivers landing page

Welcome to Uber services landing page! On this website you can find any information relating to working for Uber and becoming an Uber licensed driver.

# About

This is the website I've built while practicing my html/sass skills and working with Figma design document to create a landing page from 0.

## Technologies Used

* HTMLS/CSS/SASS

* Bootstrap

* Webpack

* Git

## Architectural Principles

* **BEM** (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even with a complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting.

## Copyright content

This website is using copyright content of Uber. I do not own any of the content. This is project was solely made to practice HTML/CSS/SASS skills.
